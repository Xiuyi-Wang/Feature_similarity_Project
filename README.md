# Overview
This repository contains the code for the Feature Similarity (FS) method proposed in our manuscript titled "Feature similarity: a sensitive method to capture the functional interaction of brain regions and networks to support flexible behavior."

The brain is a dynamic system where complex behaviors emerge from interactions across distributed regions. To accurately link brain function to cognition, tools that are sensitive to these dynamic interactions are essential. In our work, we introduce Feature Similarity (FS), a novel technique designed to capture intricate interaction patterns between brain systems.

# Key Features
FS Methodology: A more sensitive alternative to traditional functional connectivity for understanding the brain's dynamic interactions.
Task Modulation Sensitivity: FS captures interaction patterns missed by FC, particularly in task-based fMRI data.

# Repository Contents
